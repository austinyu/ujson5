# Serializing / encoding

`ujson5` API is similar to the standard `json` module with some additional features to support JSON5 syntax. If you are familiar with the `json` module, you will find `ujson5` easy to use. Like the `json` module, `ujson5` provides two main functions for encoding python objects to JSON5 strings: [dump][ujson5.dump] and [dumps][ujson5.dumps].

When using [dump][ujson5.dump] or [dumps][ujson5.dumps] functions, you can either pass in parameters or pass in a subclass of [JSON5Encoder][ujson5.encoder.JSON5Encoder] to customize the serialization process. When passing in the `default` parameter, you can exploit types exposed by the `ujson5` module to enforce type checking. Here is an example:

```python
import ujson5
from typing import Any


def default(obj: Any) -> ujson5.Serializable:
    if isinstance(obj, complex):
        return {"__complex__": True, "real": obj.real, "imag": obj.imag}
    elif isinstance(obj, set):
        return list(obj)
    raise TypeError(
        f"Object of type '{obj.__class__.__name__}' is not JSON serializable"
    )


data = {"complex": 1 + 2j}
serialized = ujson5.dumps(data, default=default)
print(serialized)
# {"complex": {"__complex__": true, "real": 1.0, "imag": 2.0}}

```

## Comments Extraction

!!! warning
Comment extraction is currently only fully supported on Python 3.12+. On older
versions, the function will still work but will not extract all comments from the
parent TypedDicts.

!!! Note
Comments will only be extracted and added when `indent` argument to [dumps][ujson5.dumps], [dump][ujson5.dump] or [JSON5Encoder][ujson5.encoder.JSON5Encoder] is set to a non-`None` value. Because if `indent` is `None`, the output will be a single line string and comments will not be added.

JSON5 supports adding comments to the data using the `//` and `/* */` syntax. These comments are ignored during the parsing process. Here is an example:

```json
{
  // Single line comment
  "key": "value",
  /* Multi-line
    comment */
  "key2": "value2"
}
```

`ujson5` makes it easy to encode python objects with comments to json5 strings with comments.

Here is an example to show how it works.

```python
from typing import TypedDict
import ujson5

class Courses(TypedDict, total=False):
    # you can also add comments in the TypedDict
    CS101: int
    # Multi-line comments are also supported
    # In this case, the comments in JSON5 will also be multi-line
    ART101: int
    # You can also add comments to the TypedDict attributes
    HIS101: int  # a comment can also be in-line
    # if a dictionary does not contain all the keys, only the keys that are
    # present will be commented
    LIT101: int


my_courses = Courses(CS101=1, ART101=2, HIS101=3)
serialized = ujson5.dumps(my_courses, Courses, indent=4)
print(serialized)
# {
#     // you can also add comments in the TypedDict
#     "CS101": 1,  // Multi-line comments are also supported
#     // In this case, the comments in JSON5 will also be multi-line
#     "ART101": 2,  // You can also add comments to the TypedDict attributes
#     "HIS101": 3,  // a comment can also be in-line
# }

```

As mentioned in the [official JSON5 website](https://json5.org/):

> JSON5 is an extension to the popular JSON file format that aims to be easier to write and maintain by hand (e.g. for config files).

Comments extraction is a very handy feature if you are going to use `TypeDict` to validate your config files. Just make sure to comment your `TypeDict` attributes and `ujson5` will take care of propagating your comments to the JSON5 output so that you can easily maintain your config files.

Here is a more complex example involving composite and inherited TypedDicts:

```python
from typing import TypedDict
import ujson5


class Courses(TypedDict, total=False):
    # you can also add comments in the TypedDict
    CS101: int
    # Multi-line comments are also supported
    # In this case, the comments in JSON5 will also be multi-line
    # The entries of dictionaries that implement this TypedDict will be commented
    ART101: int
    HIS101: int  # a comment can also be in-line
    # if a dictionary does not contain all the keys, only the keys that are
    # present will be commented
    LIT101: int


class Creature(TypedDict):
    height: int  # height of the creature
    # weight of the creature
    # weight cannot be too high!
    weight: int


class Human(Creature):  # (1)
    # age of the human
    age: int  # human can be very old!
    # name of the human
    name: str
    # human can be very intelligent
    courses: Courses  # hard-working human  (2)
    hobbies: list[str]  # hobbies takes a lot of time...

```

1. The `Human` TypedDict inherits from the `Creature` TypedDict. This means that the `Human` TypedDict will have all the attributes of the `Creature` TypedDict in addition to its own attributes. Dictionary entries that implement the `Human` TypedDict will have comments for the `Creature` TypedDict attributes as well as the `Human` TypedDict attributes.
2. The `courses` attribute of the `Human` TypedDict is a dictionary that implements the `Courses` TypedDict. This means that the dictionary entries that implement the `Human` TypedDict will have comments for the `Courses` TypedDict attributes as well as the `Human` TypedDict attributes.

Let's define some dictionaries that implement the `Human` TypedDict:

```python

bob: Human = {
    "height": 180,
    "weight": 70,
    "age": 30,
    "name": "Austin",
    "courses": {
        "CS101": 90,
        "ART101": 80,
        "HIS101": 70,
    },
    "hobbies": ["reading", "swimming", "coding"],
}

bob_str: str = ujson5.dumps(bob, Human, indent=4)
print(bob_str)
# {
#     "height": 180,  // height of the creature
#     // weight of the creature
#     // weight cannot be too high!
#     "weight": 70,
#     // (1)
#     // age of the human
#     "age": 30,  // human can be very old!
#     // name of the human
#     "name": "Austin",  // human can be very intelligent
#     "courses": {
#         // you can also add comments in the TypedDict
#         "CS101": 90,  // Multi-line comments are also supported
#         // In this case, the comments in JSON5 will also be multi-line
#         // The entries of dictionaries that implement this TypedDict will be commented
#         "ART101": 80,
#         "HIS101": 70,  // a comment can also be in-line
#     },  // hard-working human  (2)
#     "hobbies": [
#         "reading",
#         "swimming",
#         "coding",
#     ],  // hobbies takes a lot of time...
# }


jack: Human = {
    "height": 170,
    "weight": 80,
    "age": 25,
    "name": "Jack",
    "courses": {
        "CS101": 23,
        "ART101": 67,
        "LIT101": 12,
    },
    "hobbies": ["tennis", "writing", "coding"],
}

jack_str: str = ujson5.dumps(jack, Human, indent=4)
print(jack_str)
# {
#     "height": 170,  // height of the creature
#     // weight of the creature
#     // weight cannot be too high!
#     "weight": 80,
#     // (1)
#     // age of the human
#     "age": 25,  // human can be very old!
#     // name of the human
#     "name": "Jack",  // human can be very intelligent
#     "courses": {
#         // you can also add comments in the TypedDict
#         "CS101": 23,  // Multi-line comments are also supported
#         // In this case, the comments in JSON5 will also be multi-line
#         // The entries of dictionaries that implement this TypedDict will be commented
#         "ART101": 67,
#         // if a dictionary does not contain all the keys, only the keys that are
#         // present will be commented
#         "LIT101": 12,
#     },  // hard-working human  (2)
#     "hobbies": [
#         "tennis",
#         "writing",
#         "coding",
#     ],  // hobbies takes a lot of time...
# }
